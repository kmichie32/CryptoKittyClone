<!--
    Create a catalog of cats that have been created on the block chain and filtered by user.
    Remember, the id is based on the position in the kitties array
    The totalSupply() method will give the length of the array.
    ownerOf(uint256 token) will take a position in the kitty array and return the address of the owner.
    Since it's a view, you could run a loop over the length -1 and get
    a list of owners iterate over ownerOf to find  the owners. May need to figure out something better for scaling.
